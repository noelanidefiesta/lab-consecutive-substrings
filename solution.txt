The solution loops through the string and builds every possible consecutive substring. 

I used two loops: 
- one to set the starting point, 
- and another to create substrings from that point moving forward.

This way, I get all the consecutive chunks, in the order they appear, without skipping any characters.

The time complexity is O(nÂ²) since I'm looking at every combo of start and end positions. It's not the most efficient for really long strings, but it's totally fine for short or medium ones.
